This file is not needed for the bot to function and can be deleted without issue. This file is just an explanation of sorts.

Python is a beginner programming language, which is why I chose to learn it specifically. That being said, not everyone is able to learn how to code very easily..
Trust me, it took me a few years to get to where I am.. and I still consider myself a noob xD

I created this bot template to share my knowledge with people around me; maybe introduce the world of Discord bot development to people who may not have been able to
without guidance. A lot of the code in this template was donated by contributors of the project; of which have been credited accordingly in the readme.md file included
in this template.

I have tried my hardest to make something intuitive and as simple-to-use as possible. This template will change a log, so make sure to star this repo and stay up-to-date!
